# This script calculates the mapQ based on the same procedure as minimap2 (Heng Li), but uses the number of shared kmers

# mapQ = 1 â€“ f2/f1
# Where fi is the number of shared unique kemrs between a read and its alignment i. For each read, we only consider the first (f1) and second best (f2)


def main:

	# Get the dump file, alignment file

	# count how many kmers shared between read and alignment
